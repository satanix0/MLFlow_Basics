## Getting started with MLFlow
1> run pip install MLFlow
2> run mlflow ui
3> run file1.py

    - here you can see all the experiments and runs

## Setting up a remote MLFlow server using "DAGSHUB"
We will setup a remote server to trackthe experiments, instead of local server 

4> Login to dagshub using Github and Connect the project repository to which you wanna experiment with
5> run pip install dagshub, in the terminal
6> create a new file src/file2.py and copy everythig from file1.py
7> add the script in file2.py provided in dagshub repository to set tracking uri of the dagshub server and initilize the dagshub server
8> run file2.py
    - it will pen MLFlow UI in a remote server provided by dagshub
    - the remote server configuration can be shared with other collaborators.

### Autologging using MLFlow
MLFlow have the ability log important components of the projects autmatically,
